SlideCaptcha is a test, used to determine, whether the user is human, in order to deter bot attacks and spam. No jQuery needed. Only PHP and JavaScript.

## Example 1
One of the biggest advantage is that this module doesn't require any external service like Google Analytics or similar. You don't have to modify your templates either. There is also no JavaScript or image required.

````html
<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" />
<meta http-equiv="Pragma" content="no-cache" />
<meta http-equiv="Expires" content="0" />
````

## How to use
The records can be accessed via the Setup-menu of the CMS backend. The first dropdown control changes the view mode.
